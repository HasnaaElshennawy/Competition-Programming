/* 2006 World Finals
 * Problem C: Ars Longa
 * Type: Linear Algebra?
 * Difficulty Coding: ?
 * Algorithmic Difficulty: ?
 * Solution: We can set this up as a series of linear equations. The variables
 * are the amount of force along each rod. The constraints are that force on each
 * ball is 0 (including gravity). We are currently not sure how to solve this
 * because of our inability to solve over/under definited systems of linear equations.
