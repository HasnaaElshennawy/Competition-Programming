/* 2007 World Finals
 * Problem H: Raising the Roof
 * Type: Computational Geometry
 * Difficulty Coding: 5
 * Algorithmic Difficulty: ?
 * Solution: The idea is that you can start with the highest triangle 
 * then go through and remove parth from it that are obscured from things above
 * it. We believe in the worst case it is not that bad. Not too many ways to split
 * triangles and they are easily computatble.
